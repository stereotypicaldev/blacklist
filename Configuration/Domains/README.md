"Pi-hole operates by blocking requests to certain domains, preventing ads, trackers, and malicious sites from reaching users' devices. By default, most Pi-hole users rely on adlists, which are curated collections of known domains associated with advertisements, trackers, and other unwanted content. These lists can be updated regularly to ensure new domains are added as they emerge.

While adlists offer a broad and automatic solution for blocking unwanted content, blocking individual domains allows for more targeted, efficient, and personalized network filtering. It provides the flexibility to address unique needs while avoiding the potential drawbacks of over-blocking or performance degradation. By combining both strategies, Pi-hole users can achieve a well-rounded and effective approach to blocking unwanted content across their network."

**Sure, so why mine's zero?**

In my case, I haven't had the time or resources to go through and identify domains that are malicious or tracking my behavior, I am dependent mostly on adlists and the providers I choose for suggestions and my blocklists, instead opting to focus only on my whitelist, and vet the domains I allow, everything else (within reason) stays permanently blocked.
